### Hi ! I'm Gokul Soumya :wave:

I'm a college sophomore from India, doing my engineering degree in CS.

I like the command line and love making it more cozy and fun :)

I'm currently working on...

1. [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/) - A modern text editor inspired from vim and kakoune.
2. A personal todo manager written in Golang.
3. An [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) for Python written in Rust.
