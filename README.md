### Hi ! I'm Gokul Soumya :wave:

I'm a college senior from India, doing my engineering degree in CS.

I love the command line and spend most of my time there :)

I'm currently working on...

1. [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/) - A modern text editor inspired from vim and kakoune
2. A TUI library in Rust
3. A terminal frontend for GitHub
4. A terminal UI for Flutter development
